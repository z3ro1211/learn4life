 <h2>Art Hop</h2>
 <p>ArtHop occurs every 1st and 3rd Thursday of each month. Itâ€™s one of the most active and successful programs organized by the Fresno Arts Council. Art lovers and enthusiasts from all walks of life flock downtown Fresno and the Tower District on the first Thursday of each month, and the rest of ArtHop venues in the Fresno metro areas on third Thursdays, to meet and greet with the artists and enjoy the reception and music. Museums, studios, galleries and other venues open their exhibitions to the public at 5:00 p.m. and run the free event until 8:00 p.m.

ArtHop has received a remarkable response from the Fresno community. Over 50 participating artist studios, galleries, museums, and other venues exhibit art and artists reception during ArtHop, and it has become both a cultural and special event for the community with a great deal of media coverage.</p>
