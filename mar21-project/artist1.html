 <p>
   Dennis Lewis started painting at the age of seven. He was inspired to paint after his mother complemented a drawing he had made for her. Dennis works mostly in oils, creating still-life portraits of people and any objects the pleases him. aside from being an artist he also helped create some of the first video games such as <i>The Island of Dr. Brain</i>. in recent years Dennis had the urge to paint 100 portraits, some of which are in the slideshow below. unfortunately Dennis was diagnosed with cancer, he still paints though. Cancer won't keep him from his dreams. Dennis likes to paint stories into his art, he lets the viewer finish the story he has presented
